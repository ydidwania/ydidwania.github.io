With the testing framework almost ready, this week involved using what is called **fake listening** in testing to make it independent of the internet.

## What does that mean?

[Fake listening](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-client#fake-listening) means that the PulseListener instance does not actually listen for messages. You can send a message on it using `listener.fakeMessage()` and it is delivered to the listener. Route filtering is disabled in the `fake` mode. This method is almost standard in testing, using fakes wherever possible in order to **avoid using real credentials and resources**.

In order to send a fake message, I need to access that within my test files, and since I had defined them inside my api call function, there was no way I can do that. This left one option - carving out the listeners into its own component and making pulse credentials available to it. Earlier I had passed a `PulseConnection` as context to my api content. To enable fake listening I only had to set the credentials to `{fake: true}`.

## Sounds simple, doesn't it?

Well, not really. In order to access the `Listener` component in the testing framework, I will have to refactor how test suites are setup and components are loaded to be compliant with [this](https://gist.github.com/djmitche/010023b33f05bd57752397a21e0763e7#tests). Luckily a lot of services had already been converted. It made life a lot easier for me. 

For example, a [`stickyLoader`](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-lib-testing#sticky-loader) was introduced in [`taskcluster-lib-testing`](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-lib-testing) which would use the **same instance of a component**, if already present, while loading it afterwards as a dependency. Basically, **dependency injection** in technical terms. In my test suite I had invoked two functions -
* `withPulse` - which loads the listeners component(also making it accessible ) with fake credentials.
* `withServer` - loads the server component which has listeners as a dependency.

Moving the listeners into a component (and a file) of its own, created situations where an error was not caught and this caused the `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning` which crashed the server. After a few more nits, it was ready to be pushed to heroku.

## Deliverables

My [earlier PR](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-events/pull/6) got merged this week, thanks to [hassan](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/helfi/) for the quick reviews. I opened another [PR](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-events/pull/7) , for the  above changes hoping it is approved soon.  

## Coming up

I am leaving today for a family vacation to Ladakh. I will not be able to work due to poor network connectivity in these areas. I still have to get the [pulse-inspector](http://tools.taskcluster.net/pulse-inspector) compatible with the new events, and then have both deployed into production.
