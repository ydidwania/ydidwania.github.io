Hi there! I am Yashvardhan Didwania. I am currently in my sophomore year in the Electrical Engineering Department here at IIT Bombay.

I intend to use this page to maintain a blog about 
my projects and academic as well as non academic goals.

I have enjoyed coding since I was introduced to it. I started contributing to Mozilla since September last year and have been going strong for the past few months now. You can take a look at my [Github][github] profile or my [resume][resume] to know more.

I am currently the manager of [The Web and Coding Club][WnCC] of IIT Bombay where we help those who want to get started with code.
