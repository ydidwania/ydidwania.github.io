Hi there! I am Yashvardhan Didwania, a senior undergraduate at [IIT Bombay](iitb.ac.in) and pursuing a Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science an Engineering.

I am working on optimizing worker and price selection on various Crowd-labelling platforms as part of my Master's thesis with [Prof JK Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/). In the past I was a Security Engineering Intern at Sony, Japan during the Summer of 2019 and completed a [GSoC](http://localhost:4000/2018/05/01/gsoc-selection.html) with Mozilla in 2018. You can take a look at my [resume][resume] to know more about other projects I have worked on in the past.

I have been closely involved in the student community at IIT Bombay. I used to lead the [The Web and Coding Club][WnCC] of IIT Bombay where we help those who want to get started with code. I am now leading our [Developers' Community](https://devcom-iitb.org/) with a vision to design and build software projects that have a lasting impact on the institute.

I like to watch YouTube videos about the aviation industry , Poker tournaments, and infotainment channels like [VSauce](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce2), [3B1B](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) and [Cracking the Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/c/CrackingTheCryptic/). I like to read non-fiction and also write a few lines in moments of sudden inspiration.

 
<!-- I intend to use this    page to maintain a blog about 
my [projects][projects] and academic as well as non academic goals and achievements.

I have enjoyed coding since I was introduced to it. I started contributing to Mozilla since September 2017 and have been going strong since then. I even did a [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) with Mozilla in the summer of 2018. You can take a look at my [Github][github] profile or my  to know more.

I am also the manager of [The Web and Coding Club][WnCC] of IIT Bombay where we help those who want to get started with code. -->
