Hi there! I am Yashvardhan Didwania, a senior undergraduate at IIT Bombay and pursuing a Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science an Engineering.

I am working on optimizing worker and price selection on various Crowd-labelling platforms as part of my Master's thesis with Prof JK Nair. In the past I was a Security Engineering Intern at Sony, Japan during the Summer of 2019 and completed a GSoC with Mozilla in 2018. You can take a look at my [resume][resume] to know more about other projects I have worked on.

I have been closely involved in the student community at IIT Bombay. I used to lead the [The Web and Coding Club][WnCC] of IIT Bombay where we help those who want to get started with code. I am now leading our [Developers' Community](https://devcom-iitb.org/) with a vision to design and build software projects that have a lasting impact on the institute.

I like to watch YouTube videos about the aviation industry , Poker tournaments, and infotainment channels like VSauce2 , 3B1B and Cracking the Cryptic. I also like to read non-fiction and sometimes also write a few lines whenever inspiration strikes

 
I intend to use this    page to maintain a blog about 
my [projects][projects] and academic as well as non academic goals and achievements.

I have enjoyed coding since I was introduced to it. I started contributing to Mozilla since September 2017 and have been going strong since then. I even did a [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) with Mozilla in the summer of 2018. You can take a look at my [Github][github] profile or my  to know more.

I am also the manager of [The Web and Coding Club][WnCC] of IIT Bombay where we help those who want to get started with code.
