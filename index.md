Hi there! I am Yashvardhan Didwania. I am currently in  my sophomore year in the Electrical Engineering Department  here at IIT Bombay.

I intend to use this page to maintain a blog about 
my projects and academic as well as non academic goals.

Some of my favourite pastimes are reading and watching movies.I love to Code.I am interested in Software Development and want to start contributung to Open Source projects soon.

Coming to IIT Bombay has given me a lot of exposure to the Programming World in general and a chance to learn new things everyday.I have also worked on quite a few [projects][projects].

I am currently a member of [The Web n Coding Club][WnCC] of IIT Bombay where we help those who want to get started on Code.
